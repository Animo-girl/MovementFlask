This is a simple bot that atkes a few input from the user and then provide output based on the following problem statement:
Create an AI based system using GenAI model on your computer that detects a person's movement (a smartphone always accompanies the user) and tells the person at regular interval the kind of movement the person's is doing, i.e. walking, running or stepping on the stairs. And based upon the user's age, gender, weight, location, & temperature should give a proper human like response (from GenAI) what might happen to the user, whether it is safe to do such activities, should the user take a break, must the user change his/her speed or type of activity etc.
